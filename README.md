#Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢

This project predicts the survival of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning models (Logistic Regression and Random Forest) with structured EDA and data visualization.

📂 Project Overview

Objective: Predict passenger survival based on features like age, sex, and passenger class.
Skills Applied: EDA, data visualization, feature engineering, machine learning modeling, evaluation.

📊 Dataset

Titanic dataset (Kaggle)

Features: age, sex, passenger class, siblings, fare, etc.

Target: Survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)


🧩 Features

Handled missing values for Age and Embarked

Encoded Sex and Embarked as numerical

Created FamilySize from SibSp + Parch

Used Pclass and Fare for socioeconomic signals
